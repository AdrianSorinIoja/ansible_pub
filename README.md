# 🧪 Lab Automation Scripts (Ansible + Bash)

Welcome to my personal collection of Ansible playbooks and Bash scripts built for **lab/testing environments**. These are designed to help automate tasks quickly and efficiently in a controlled test lab setup.

## 📁 What's Inside

- ✅ Ansible playbooks (`.yml`) for automating tasks across test infrastructure.
- 🐚 Bash scripts for manual or semi-automated use cases.
- 🔄 Focused on tasks related to virtualization, system configuration, and Citrix/XenServer lab scenarios.

> **⚠️ WARNING:**
> These scripts and playbooks are intended **strictly for lab use only**.  
> They are **not production-ready** and come with **no guarantees**. Use them at your own risk.
> 
> Always test thoroughly in a safe environment before adapting anything for broader use!

## 🛠 Requirements

- Ansible (version X.X or newer)
- Bash-compatible shell (Linux/macOS)
- Lab systems (e.g. XenServer, Windows, or Linux VMs)
- Optional: WinRM setup for managing Windows hosts with Ansible

## 📦 Example Use Cases

- Deploying and configuring Citrix VDAs
- Automating XenServer patching and setup
- Setting up infrastructure quickly for testing scenarios
